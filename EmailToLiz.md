# Email
Dear Liz Felton
Hope this email finds you well. With regards to the RobotDayManagementSystem we were wondering if you can provide us with the system requirments that were produced last year and which our project needs to adhear to. We feel this is important to help use create our EOI video, as we would have a better understanding of the details of what we are implimenting. If this at all possible it would be much apprciated.

Kind regards, Group 43

# Our plan so far
In our EOI I think it is important to talk about the structure of the data base we are planning to impliment. Although this will probably depend on the system requirments we need to adhear to. We could then talk about how we are going to desing the user interface ect. Also I think our software creation process like weather we use waterfall or Extreme programming is something we should include.

# What do you think is important to include in our EOI? 
In the understanding part, I think we could include understanding of the documents from previous cohort.
For preliminary analysis, we could conclude three core components: database, front-end system, software life user cycle.
For project management, we could claim that we will use agile methodology as you mentioned extreme programming, emphasizing iterative development and flexible adjustment.
Maybe we could also list our team skills and capability and also deliverables summary.


# Also do you know if there are any examplers we could look at?
Maybe we can ask GPT?
